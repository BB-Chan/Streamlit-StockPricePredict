As an AI enthusiast and leisure trader, I design this Streamlit program to analyze stock prices by traditional technical indicators and contemporary machine learning models.
This program consists three parts - 
1st : stock data download from yfinance, then analyzed by technical indicators(MACD & DMI as Trend, RSI & KDJ as Momentum, and BB & BIAS as Volatility). 
2nd : apply machine learning models (XgB, GRU, LSTM, LSTM-Attention & LSTM-Features) to predict 'Close' price of next trading day.
3rd : save trained ML models and re-load for next prediction.
